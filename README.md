# SoftwareDecode
This is a project written in C++ for a CS310 - Data Structures class in Fall 2019. This project decodes the information found in an input file, matches it with patterns found in a pattern file, and outputs an output file listing all of the decoded signals. This project utilizes a custom-made Queue data structure.
